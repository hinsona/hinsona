- 👋 Hi, I’m @hinsona
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, architecture, patterns and practices. In my spare time I enjoy RPG video games, weight lifting, and vacationing with my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Delphi, C#, SQL, Git, Azure. There's so much to learn that you can never stop learning.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate ... My free time is spent relaxing and doing things other than writing software.
- 📫 How to reach me: hinsona@familyfco.com
