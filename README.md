- 👋 Hi, I’m @hinsona
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, architecture, patterns and practices. In my spare time I enjoy RPG video games, weight lifting, and vacationing with my family.
- 🌱 I have over 20 years experience in software development. My primary focus is on Delphi, C#, SQL, Git, Azure but not necessarily in that order. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate ... My free time is spent relaxing and doing things unrelated to software.
- 📫 How to reach me: hinsona@familyfco.com or ahinson@smg.inc
